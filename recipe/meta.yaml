  summary: An open-source Python package for writing DLIS files.
  description: |
    dliswriter allows you to specify the structure, data, and metadata of your DLIS file 
    in a simple and flexible fashion, and takes care of creating the binary file. 
    The file writing time is pretty much linearly dependent on the amount of data (number of rows).
